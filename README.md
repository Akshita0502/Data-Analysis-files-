*STUDENT PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS DASHBOARD*

* Problem Statement:-
This project aims to analyze student performance data to answer the following key questions:

1. Which students passed/failed based on average score?
   
2. What is the average study hours of passing vs failing students?

3. Who studied the most but still scored below average?

* Key Insights & Recommendations:-
 
-Students who failed studied the least (~4 hours on average).

-Higher study hours & attendance â†’ better performance.

-Some students (e.g., Arjun) scored average in every subject, showing the need for balanced improvement across all subjects.

-Regular attendance (>85%) is strongly linked with higher scores.

#Tools & Libraries Used:-

1. Python (Pandas, NumPy)

2. Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
