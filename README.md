* Problem Statement:-
This project aims to analyze student performance data to answer the following key questions:
Which students passed/failed based on average score?
What is the average study hours of passing vs failing students?
Who studied the most but still scored below average?

* Key Insights & Recommendations:-
Students who failed studied the least (~4 hours on average).
Higher study hours & attendance â†’ better performance.
Some students (e.g., Arjun) scored average in every subject, showing the need for balanced improvement across all subjects.
Regular attendance (>85%) is strongly linked with higher scores.

#Tools & Libraries Used:-
Python (Pandas, NumPy)
Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
